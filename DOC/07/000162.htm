	<p class="manual_std">The <b>MTA</b> (Milestone Trend Analysis) is a method for monitoring current project progress.<br /><br />The <b>MTA</b> helps to better control or estimate the schedule progress of the projects. With the <b>MTA</b> it is possible to detect schedule shifts (delays or completions) at an early stage in order to be able to react accordingly. The prerequisite for the <b>MTA</b> are firmly defined milestone dates.</p>

	<p class="manual_std">Control screen for selecting display criteria for the <b>MTA</b> (Milestone Trend Analysis) graph.<br /><br />If a project date is changed, the new date on the change date (= report date) is defined as the new target date (= milestone date). This is entered in the MTA accordingly. If not, the old date is retained. In the course of a project, there are usually many such date shifts. Therefore, a corresponding number of new target dates (that is, the milestone date is moved back or forward) are collected for each milestone. These dates result in a trend for each milestone. This is visualized by means of the graphical evaluation of the MTA.<br /><br />Based on the curve, a trend can be calculated whether, and if so, where the deadline will most likely shift.<br /><br /><u>A distinction is made between four basic principles:</u><br /><ul><br /><li>A horizontal trend means no deadlines have been postponed (yet), i.e. the deadline will be met as planned.</li><br /><li>A downward trend indicates that the planned date will be reached earlier, i.e. subsequently planned projects can be brought forward.</li><br /><li>An upward trend indicates that the planned deadline cannot be met. Subsequent projects and possibly the whole project are in danger and have to be postponed.</li><br /><li>A zigzag course indicates that there are uncertainties in the planning of the target dates. It cannot be estimated whether the deadline can be met or not. Possibly the whole project must be planned again.</li><br /></ul><br /><hr><br /><br /><font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Project Name</font><br />From the selection field, a project must be selected to the milestones exist.<br /><br /><font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Time Span from</font> + <font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Time Span to</font><br />The time period can be defined accordingly if desired.

For example, if a project goes over 365 days (1 year) and you enter <b>12</b> in this field, the period will be divided into 12 sections of 30-31 days each (= 365/12) and you will thus get one report time for each month.

Each milestone that is displayed in the graphic is also listed here. The individual actual dates (= report dates) are numbered consecutively and displayed with the corresponding planned target dates (= milestone dates). The difference to the originally planned milestone date (= date next to milestone name) results in the shift in days, which is visually displayed in the MTA.<br /><br />On the basis of the curve, the estimated end date for projects that have not yet been completed is displayed as a result, as well as the actual end date for completed projects.<br /><br />End dates are always on the hypotenuse, with completed end dates shown with a border and estimated end dates in brackets. Estimated end dates can also be displayed as a line on the hypotenuse, depending on the curve progression, as the two end points are always calculated, once from the end point based on the curve progression and once as a horizontal line if the last milestone date reached is retained.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br /><font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Number</font><br />Numbering of each report time point.<br /><br /><font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Actual End Date</font><br />Each report time point corresponds to the last change date of a target date.<br /><br /><font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Planned End Date</font><br />Currently set target date at the report time.<br /><br /><font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Delta-Difference</font><br />Difference in days of the current target date to the original target date.<br /><br /><font class="manual_bld" color="#5a5a5a">Personnel master sheet</font><br />Graphical display of difference as a trend arrow.<br /></p>
