The employer can reimburse his employee for overnight expenses tax-free: In the amount of the expenses proven by receipt or, without proof, in the amount of the flat-rate amount, which varies from country to country, insofar as the employee did not receive the accommodation free of charge or at a reduced price from the employer or from a third party due to his employment relationship.<br /><br />The tax-free payment of the lump sum is also not permitted in the case of overnight accommodation in a vehicle. In the case of use of a sleeping car or a ship's cabin, the lump sums may only be paid tax-free if the overnight stay has begun or ended in another accommodation.<br /><br />For such days, the overnight allowances shall be deactivated.<br /><br />Since 2008, entrepreneurs can no longer claim any lump sums for overnight stays at all. Costs for overnight stays can now only be claimed by entrepreneurs as business expenses in the amount actually incurred, which must be proven by receipt.<br />Always make sure to deposit the currently valid statutory flat rates, otherwise trips can no longer be correctly accounted for tax purposes!<br /></p>
