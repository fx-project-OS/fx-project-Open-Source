	<p class="manual_std">In order to be able to create a project, some prerequisites have to be met so that the mandatory fields can be filled in during input:<br /><br /><br /><b>Create client:</b><br /><br />When defining the project, it is important that the principals have already been entered in the <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Creation&gt;Customers&gt;Basic Data</font> program function. In addition, the contact person must be defined in <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Creation&gt;Customers&gt;Contact Person</font>. Only if these requirements are met, a project can also be assigned to a principal.<br /><br /><br /><b>Employee data:</b><br /><br />In order to be able to plan a project completely, all employees involved in the project should be created in the program functions <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Creation&gt;Employees&gt;Basic Data</font> or <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Creation&gt;Contractors&gt;Basic Data</font> beforehand. Likewise, the settings regarding working time and availability should be correctly stored in the respective additional data.<br />The resource planning is then done either in the function <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Planning&gt;Persons&gt;Assign Person Resources (HR)</font> or most simply directly in the graphical project planning <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Planning&gt;Projects&gt;Matrix: Graphically as Gantt</font>.<br /><br /><br /><b>Determine project manager, deputy project manager and project manager:</b><br /><br />In order to select a project manager, the appropriate employee roles must be assigned to the desired individuals. To do this, first go to the program function <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Creation&gt;Employees&gt;Roles</font> (for internal persons) or <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Creation&gt;Contractors&gt;Roles</font> (for external persons) and assign a special "employee role" to the corresponding employee, in this case project manager or project manager.<br /><br /><br />In addition, special skills of the employees can be stored, so that employees with special knowledge can be found more quickly during resource planning. These skills are also stored in the project, in order to be able to make later appropriate evaluations on projects. In <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Administration&gt;Skills&gt;Skill Groups</font> and <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Administration&gt;Skills&gt;Skills</font>, the characteristics of these skills can be defined individually as a group and subgroup.<br /><br /><br /><b>Creating a project:</b><br /><br />Once the above requirements are met, the desired project can be defined in <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Creation&gt;Projects&gt;Create Main Project</font>. In the second step, using the graphical input in <font class="manual_bld" color="#005077">Planning&gt;Projects&gt;Matrix: Graphically as Gantt</font>, the project can be designed in the matrix, the effort can be planned, The project details can be set and the resources can be assigned.</p>
