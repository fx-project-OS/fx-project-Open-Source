	<p class="manual_std">Specify the selection and display criteria for the <b>Earned Value Analysis (EVA)</b>.<br /><br />The determined data are prepared and displayed in a graphic chart and optionally in table form.<br /><br /><br /><br />The displayed data is determined based on the selected tasks. The underlying tasks can be influenced by the following parameters:<ul>.<br /><li><b>Project:</b><br />A project must be selected from the complete project list. This list contains all project types (parent project, subproject or task) to which one has corresponding rights. When selecting parent or sub-projects, the underlying tasks are automatically expanded to include all tasks subordinate to this project. When selecting a task, only that task will be used as the base.</li><br /><li><b>Mainly responsible persons:</b><br />If main responsible persons such as client, project manager or project manager are selected, the underlying tasks are automatically narrowed down to the tasks the selected person is assigned to.</li><br /><li><b>Project status:</b><br />If one or more project statuses are checked, the underlying tasks are automatically narrowed down to the tasks that have the corresponding status. If no status is checked, or if all statuses are checked, no restriction is applied.</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><br />If the determined data should be displayed not only as a graphic diagram, but also in table form, then simply the checkbox next to the <b>Table view</b> field must be checked. The amount of information displayed can be specified with the <b>Display Type</b> selection box. The choices here are:<ul><br /><li><b>Automatic</b><br />On the basis of the number of days in the determined period, the most suitable display type is determined. "Suitable" here means: the list should consist of a maximum of 60 information lines.</li><br /><li><b>Day(s)</b><br />Each day of the determined time period is displayed.</li><br /><li><b>Week(s)</b><br />Only the first day of each week in the determined time period is displayed.</li><br /><li><b>Month(s)</b><br />Only the first day of each month (= first of the month) in the determined period is displayed.</li><br /><li><b>Quarter(s)</b><br />Only the first day of each quarter in the determined period is displayed.</li><br /><li><b>Year(s)</b><br />Only the first of January of each year in the determined time period is displayed.</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><b class="s4">NOTE:</b><br />The table always displays the first and last day of the determined period.<br />The graph chart is always based on day-exact data, i.e. the restriction of the <b>display type</b> has no effect on the chart, but only on the rows of the table to be displayed.<br /></p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Act. Eff.:</b></p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">PC:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">The <b>planned costs (PC)</b> are defined when a project is defined and correspond to the summed planned total internal budget (= people budget + material budget) of all subordinate tasks at a given point in time.<br /><br />For the <b>Earned Value Analysis</b>, a linear planning progression is assumed in the specified project period, i.e. a task which, for example, goes over 10 days with a planned budget of 1,000.00 Euros is planned with a daily consumption of 100.00 Euros = 1,000.00 Euros / 10 days.<br />Other names for planned costs (PC):<ul><li>Planned Value (= Planned Value "PV")</li><li>Target Cost of Work Scheduled "SKBA" (= Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled "BCWS")</li></ul><br /></p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">AC:</b></p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">EV:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">The <b>performance value (EV)</b> of a project corresponds to the degree of completion of all subordinate tasks at a certain point in time in relation to the planned costs (PC) and the percentage work progress determined via the target/actual comparison (SI), i.e.<br /><b>performance value (EV) = planned costs (PC) * target/actual comparison (SI)</b>.<br /><br />The <b>Effort Value (EV)</b> indicates the actual value of the effort already expended at a given point in time.<br />Other names for performance value (EV):<ul><li>Budgeted Cost of Work Already Completed "SKAA" (= Budgeted Cost of Work Performed "BCWP")</li><br /></p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">SV:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">The <b>plan variance (SV)</b> of a project is equal to the difference in the earned value (EV) minus the planned cost (PC) of all subordinate tasks at a given point in time, i.e.<br /><b>plan variance (SV) = earned value (EV) - planned cost (PC)</b>.<br /><br />A <b>negative</b> plan variance generally means, when planning is accurate, that the plan cost is higher than the value corresponding to the degree of progress already achieved, i.e. the work progress is most likely lagging behind the plan.<br /><br />A <b>positive</b> plan variance generally means, with exact planning, that the value corresponding to the degree of progress already achieved is higher than the plan costs, i.e. the work on the task is most likely to be completed earlier.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">CV:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">The <b>cost variance (CV)</b> of a project is equal to the difference of the activity value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC) of all subordinate tasks at a certain point in time, i.e.<br /><b>cost variance (CV) = activity value (EV) - actual cost (AC)</b>.<br /><br />A <b>negative</b> cost variance generally means, with accurate planning, that the actual cost is higher than the value corresponding to the degree of progress already achieved, i.e., the work progress is most likely lagging behind the plan.<br /><br />A <b>positive</b> cost variance generally means, with exact planning, that the value corresponding to the degree of progress already achieved is higher than the actual costs, i.e. the work on the task will most likely be completed earlier.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">SPI:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">The <b>time efficiency (SPI)</b> for a project indicates how large the time deviation of the individual subordinate tasks is from the planned time expenditure. To calculate this, the performance value (EV) is set in relation to the planned costs (PC), i.e.<br /><b>Time efficiency (SPI) = performance value (EV) / planned costs (PC)</b>.<br /><br />A time efficiency value <b>greater</b> than 1.00, if accurately planned, most likely indicates that tasks will be completed faster than planned, i.e., the project can be completed faster.<br />For example, an SPI value of 2.00 indicates that tasks will be completed twice as fast as planned.<br /><br />A time efficiency value <b>less</b> than 1.00, when planned accurately, most likely indicates that the tasks will be completed slower than planned, i.e. the project is in danger of falling behind schedule or is already behind schedule.<br />An SPI value of 0.50, for example, indicates that the tasks will be completed only half as fast as planned.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">CPI:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">The <b>cost efficiency (CPI)</b> for a project indicates how large the cost variance of the individual subordinate tasks is from the planned costs. To calculate this, the performance value (EV) is set in relation to the actual costs (AC), i.e.<br /><b>Cost efficiency (SPI) = performance value (EV) / actual costs (AC)</b>.<br /><br />A cost efficiency value <b>greater</b> than 1.00, if accurately planned, most likely indicates that the tasks cost less than planned, i.e., the project can be completed more cheaply.<br />For example, a CPI value of 2.00 indicates that the tasks cost half as much as planned.<br /><br />A cost-effectiveness value <b>less</b> than 1.00, if planned accurately, most likely indicates that the tasks will cost more than planned, i.e. the project will be more expensive.<br />For example, a CPI value of 0.50 indicates that the tasks will cost twice as much as planned.</p>
