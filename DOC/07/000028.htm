		<p class="manual_std">This field displays the individual employee skill groups, that is, the employee areas that they cover.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Skill Name:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">This field contains the names of the skills of the individual persons, e.g. "English", "Russian" or similar as skills for the group "foreign languages".</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Start:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">This field specifies the plan start date. When created, it is identical to the project start date when the employee was assigned, but it can be changed later.</p>

		<p class="manual_std">This field specifies the plan end date. When created, it is identical to the project end date on which the employee was assigned, but it can be changed later.</p>

		<p class="manual_std">Monetary value, the amount of which shows the financial expenditure for the company per hour of use of a worker or a material (counterpart to VK=sales price). Here the EK (purchase price) is to be entered, which the resource receives for the current project.<br /><br />Example: An employee has a purchase price of 25 €. If he works on a "normal" project, his purchase price is also 25 €. But if he works on a project that needs all his experience, the price can be adjusted to this project (e.g. price 40 €). The adjustment is also possible for the sales price.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">SP:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">Monetary value, the amount of which shows the financial return for the company per day of use of a worker or a material (counterpart to EK=purchase price). The sales price that the resource generates for the current project must be entered here.<br /><br />Example: An employee has a sales price of 40 €. If he works on a "normal" project, his sales price is also 40 €, but if he works on a project that requires all his experience, the sales price can be adjusted to this project (e.g. sales price 60 €). The adjustment is also possible for the EK.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Effort:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">Specifies how many hours an employee should spend on a task.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">%:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">Percent (%)<br /></p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Utilizat.:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">Indicates the percentage to which a resource is already utilized (by other projects).<br /><br />Materials always have 100% capacity utilization when allocated.<br /><br />For employees, the utilization is calculated from the values of the target workday and the target effort for the task.<br />For example, an employee with a standard eight-hour day is assigned to a task with a target effort of 24 hours. The duration of the task is three days.<br />=>Within these three days, the employee can work three times eight hours according to the target workday<br />=>24 hours / (3 * 8 hours) => 1 => Utilization of the employee is exactly 100% for this task.<br />Now let's assume the same task is now to be completed in four days<br />=>24 hours / (4 * 8 hours) => 0.75 => Utilization of the employee is exactly 75% for this task.<br />If more than one employee is assigned to a task, the workload can be split so that, for example, one employee does 16 hours and the other does 8 hours. With a standard eight-hour day and a task runtime of four days, the workloads of the two employees in the case just mentioned would be 50% (=> 32 / 16) and 25% (=> 32 / 8) respectively.<br /><br />The total workload of an employee for an appointment is calculated from the individual workloads within the tasks for this appointment, i.e. if an employee has three tasks assigned on one day, with individual workloads of 40%, 30% and 20%, then the total workload for this employee for this day would be 90%.<br /><br />Missing days and holidays are taken into account in the workload calculation<br />.</p>
