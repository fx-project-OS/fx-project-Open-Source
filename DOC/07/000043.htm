<br />
	<p class="manual_std">The resource planning of persons is used to display as well as to assign resources. Basically, persons are assigned to tasks, because time recording can only be done on tasks. If a person is assigned to a project or subproject, this person is also automatically assigned to all underlying tasks. When selecting tasks, multiple selection is possible, which is achieved by holding down the CTRL key. Persons with certain skills can be filtered for display using the "Skill" selection field. If the checkmark is set at "Show projects", already assigned projects of the individual persons are graphically displayed.</p>
