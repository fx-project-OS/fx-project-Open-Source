<p class="manual_bld" style="color:#888888;">Filter settings in fx-projectÂ® can be named and help to reduce the amount of data and simplify e.g. extensive evaluations</p>
<br />
	<p class="manual_std">With the help of the data filter, the amount of data used can be reduced with regard to persons, time and projects. This restriction reduces the display and increases the clarity. For example, the number of projects can be reduced to two, so that the corresponding reports are only applied to these two projects.<br /><br />The filter can be switched on or off at the top right (red or green rectangle to the right of the filter symbol). In the masks in which the filter can be used, a filter symbol is visible in the selection mask of the program function in the upper right corner.</p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Text Add. (Head):</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">Text field for general text input.<br /></p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey"><i>Person</i>:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">The field Person_Completed is identical with exactly one field "Name". It stands for a person who has completed a task/problem.<br /><br />This field normally has the same value as the field Person_responsible, unless the person who solved the problem would be different from the one who was initially responsible for the problem.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey"><i>Name</i>:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">In this field the family name of the person or the name of the legal entity (e.g. company name) is displayed or entered.<br /></p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey"><i>Date Entry</i>:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">With the help of the field "Date specification" you can directly display a desired day.<br /><br />This option is preferable if you want to "jump" over a longer period of time, because here only one date has to be entered instead of a tedious scrolling forward or backward.</p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Act. Start:</b></p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">1st Project L.:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">In this field the manager of a project is displayed or must be selected from a selection list. The project manager is defined once in the master project, and is then preselected as a PROPOSAL in all underlying projects.<br /><br /><font class=green>Green</font> displayed persons in the selection field are project leaders, which are already assigned to at least one project in this role.<br /><br />Project managers are created using the role mask with role "Project Manager".<br /></p>

		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Hide Archive:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">By setting this "archiving indicator", complete mother projects can be archived, i.e. the data is retained, but these projects are no longer displayed in the selection fields or in the project menu. This makes it possible to reduce the list of projects.<br />A mother project can only be "archived" if it has already been completed, i.e. the status of the mother project and consequently of all subordinate projects must be set to "completed"<br />.<br /></p>
		<p class="manual_std"><b class="darkgrey">Only Order Pr.:</b></p>
		<p class="manual_std">If this field is activated in the filter settings, only projects generated from orders are displayed.</p>
