	<p class="manual_std">fx-project is a 100% web-based project management and controlling system on internet/intranet basis. JavaScript elements are used to increase the user usability. This enables location-independent working for all project participants without prior installation of a program on a computer. A common browser is sufficient and the basis for a worldwide language-independent collaboration is created.<br><br><center><img src="../../GFX/zfx_structure_7.png" width="542" align="middle" style="vertical-align:middle;"></center><br><br><br /><h3>Why project management?</h3><br />Recent studies (including Time Kontor) have shown that about 20% of projects fail, or are canceled (depending on the industry). If projects fail, this is mostly due to exceeded time and cost agreements. An important factor here are the resources in the form of qualified employees. Controlling is responsible for ensuring that deadlines can be met. fx-project supports project management in all necessary areas to ensure that a project reaches its planned goal in organisational terms.<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Project management</h3><br />When defining projects, all necessary information is recorded. In this process, a project can branch into any number of parts. Usually, a project consists of a mother project (= main project), which can be divided into any number of sub-projects (= collective projects or sub-projects). The subprojects can again be divided into tasks (= work packages), which represent the smallest project parts.<br><br><center><img src="../../GFX/zproject_structure_7.png" width="526" align="middle" style="vertical-align:middle;"></center><br><br /><br><br /><h3>100% internet and intranet based</h3>.<br />fx-project is 100% internet and intranet based. This means that users are independent of location and can check on the current status of their projects at any time.<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Operating system independent</h3><br />An enormous advantage of fx-project is that it is operating system independent.<br /><br />(Server: Windows, LINUX or UNIX Sun Solaris, Client: any HTML 5.0 compatible browser)<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Browser Independent</h3>.<br />In addition to operating system independence, fx-project offers full browser independence. Whether Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome or Apple Safari is used, fx-project is browser-independent and does not restrict the user's choice.<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Database independent</h3><br />fx-project comes standard for MS-SQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Data security</h3><br />Server-side SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption or VPN are, of course, available on request.<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Multilingualism</h3><br />Of course, a system that can be used worldwide must also have multilingualism, so fx-project. By default, fx-project is delivered in German and English. However, the entire system can be translated into other foreign languages in a short time.<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Client capability</h3><br />fx-project is multi-client capable. Each client is an independent self-contained system.<br><br /><br><br /><h3>Data dictionary based information system</h3>.<br />fx-project is built on a base system developed specifically for this purpose. All information is mapped centrally in a DataDictionary (DD) and is constantly in connection with the programs. Whether layout, report, help or documentation, the information always comes from the DD.</p>
