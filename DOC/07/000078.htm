<br />
	<p class="manual_std"><b>Instant materials</b> are materials that can be assigned once to tasks, e.g. computers, printers, etc.. If a material is assigned to a task, the corresponding costs and/or revenues are directly transferred to the project budget. Whether an instant material is billable or not can be defined by an entry in the date field "Billable from".<br /><br /><b>Consumable materials</b> are materials which can be consumed by a person on a unit basis (pieces, meters, etc.) to the exact day, e.g. cables, sockets, etc. The date fields "Start date" and "End date" can be used to specify the period in which this material can be consumed. A consumable material can generally be used by all persons and can be added to authorized tasks. Consumables can optionally be defined as stock items, so that their stocks can be controlled in the stock management.<br /><br /><b>Time materials</b> are materials which can be used by a person by the hour and to the day, analogous to time recording, e.g. company cars, rented rooms, etc. The date fields "Start date" and "End date" can be used to define the period in which this material can be used. A time material can generally be used by all persons and can be added to authorized tasks. For time materials, it is also possible to define on which days of the week and for how many hours/day they are available, just like for persons (HR).</p>
