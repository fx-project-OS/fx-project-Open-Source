		<p class="manual_std">Indicates the percentage to which a resource is already utilized (by other projects).<br /><br />Materials always have 100% capacity utilization when allocated.<br /><br />For employees, the utilization is calculated from the values of the target workday and the target effort for the task.<br />For example, an employee with a standard eight-hour day is assigned to a task with a target effort of 24 hours. The duration of the task is three days.<br />=>Within these three days, the employee can work three times eight hours according to the target workday<br />=>24 hours / (3 * 8 hours) => 1 => Utilization of the employee is exactly 100% for this task.<br />Now let's assume the same task is now to be completed in four days<br />=>24 hours / (4 * 8 hours) => 0.75 => Utilization of the employee is exactly 75% for this task.<br />If more than one employee is assigned to a task, the workload can be split so that, for example, one employee does 16 hours and the other does 8 hours. With a standard eight-hour day and a task runtime of four days, the workloads of the two employees in the case just mentioned would be 50% (=> 32 / 16) and 25% (=> 32 / 8) respectively.<br /><br />The total workload of an employee for an appointment is calculated from the individual workloads within the tasks for this appointment, i.e. if an employee has three tasks assigned on one day, with individual workloads of 40%, 30% and 20%, then the total workload for this employee for this day would be 90%.<br /><br />Missing days and holidays are taken into account in the workload calculation<br />.</p>
