	<p class="manual_std">Basically, there are three different types of programs in fx-project: <b>default programs</b>, <b>administrator programs</b> and <b>user programs</b>.<br /><br /><b>1. Standard Programs</b>.<br />Standard programs are program functions that are automatically assigned to each user without any special assignment of rights, such as user preference, password, filter, etc. This means at the same time that every new user needs at least as many license points as necessary for the standard programs.<br /><br /><b>2. Admin Programs</b>.<br />Admin programs are special program functions that can only be used by the main administrator or a user with administrator rights, such as the new creation of clients, users or special programs to reset the password for a user.<br /><br /><b>3. User Programs</b>.<br />User programs are program functions that can be assigned to any normal user, such as time tracking, control center, scheduler, etc.</p>
