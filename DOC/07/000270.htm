In the case of use of a sleeping car or a ship's cabin, the lump sums may only be paid tax-free if the overnight stay has begun or ended in another accommodation.<br /><br />For such days, the overnight allowances shall be deactivated.<br /><br />Since 2008, entrepreneurs can no longer claim any lump sums for overnight stays at all. Costs for overnight stays can now only be claimed by entrepreneurs as business expenses in the amount actually incurred, which must be proven by receipt.<br />Always make sure to deposit the currently valid statutory flat rates, otherwise trips can no longer be correctly accounted for tax purposes!<br /></p>
