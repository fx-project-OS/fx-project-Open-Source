ctd_ins_note:		During the initial installation, you have the option of creating test data to help you get started with fx-project. This test data can be changed at any time.<br /><br /><br /><b>What is created?</b><br /><br /><ul style="padding-left:8px;"><li><!--#TDUCN#--> <b>Users</b> in addition to the administrator just created for people with the corresponding roles and the following password:<br /><br /><table width=100%><tr><td width=50%><!--#TDUSR#--></td><td><span class="lit">Password:</span><br /><!--#TDUPW#--></td></tr></table><br /></li><li>A profile &quot;<b>Open Source</b>&quot;, i.e. a collection of program authorizations, which contains all open source program functions. This is assigned to each user, i.e. each above-mentioned user can use all open source functionalities immediately. In addition, leading users are also assigned &quot;<b>Special Profiles</b>&quot; which are only active if the corresponding special programs are available.<br /><br /></li><li>A <b>Customer</b>, as well as their contact person - are needed to be able to create a project.<br /><br /></li><li>A <b>Contact</b>, as well as their contact person.<br /><br /></li><li>A <b>Main Project</b> for the current year with 2 sub-projects with 2 tasks each and resources already allocated.</li></ul>
ctd_ins_del:		If you want to delete some of the above-mentioned persons after creating the test data, you must first delete either the corresponding resource assignment in the tasks or the entire main project. This is necessary because fx-project checks dependencies before deleting to avoid missing references!
ctd_err_empty:		The test data definition file &quot;<!--#TDFN#-->&quot; for fx-project could not be loaded or is empty!
ctd_err_none:		No valid test data inserts found!
ctd_err_insert:		An error occurred while inserting a test data set into the table &quot;<!--#TDTN#-->&quot;!<br /><br />You can find more detailed information in the log file.
ctd_ins_ok:		All test data has been successfully created.<br /><br />You can now log in to client 1 as "<b>admin</b>" or as one of the following users with the password you have assigned:<br /><br /><!--#TDUSR#-->
ctd_ins_skip:		The test data was not created according to your request!<br /><br />You can now log in as "<b>admin</b>" in client 1 with the password you have assigned.
